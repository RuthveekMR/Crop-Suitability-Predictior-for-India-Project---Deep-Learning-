## 📌 Project Overview (High-Level)

The project investigates how environmental data such as climate and soil information can be used to support agricultural planning across diverse geographic regions in India.

At a high level, the system follows a structured pipeline involving:
1. Data collection
2. Data preprocessing
3. Feature preparation
4. Model development
5. Result presentation

All implementation details, modeling strategies, evaluation logic, and system extensions are excluded from public disclosure.
